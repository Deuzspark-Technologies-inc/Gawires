Gawires(a.k.a *Game Assets Wires*) is a new genre version control system designed around making the management of large projects like video games simpler.

Gawires is written entirely in *Rust-Lang* to provide the best performance. It is also my first project ever using rust but i think this is an incredible langage that fit into the goal of gawires!

This vcs try to solves the problem of other vcs like git, that is challenging in large project with larger teams and Perforce that add much useless complexity(And is pretty expensive).

This will be a long road but i think that the game industry needs something new for their own reality instead of relying to some general solution. We work with much more complex and large files like 3d files, textures, sounds and more. And those also need to be controlled and versionned. Thus my plan is to make this vcs different than what is available, thus using modern and awesome technologies.

Feel free to join me if you have any questions or want to give an hand! Thanks :)
